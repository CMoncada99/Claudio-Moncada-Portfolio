	<h3>Projects&nbsp;</h3>
      <p> This is a showcase of a couple of projects that I worked on during my graduate student career. The three projects in display here showcase my skills in different areas such as Data Visualization, Project Management and Coding with Visualization.

<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to the SQL Project. </b> </center> </div>
<div>
<p> The aforementioned project was successfully completed during the Fall 2021 semester. The project involved a comprehensive analysis of multiple Spotify data sets, leveraging data integration techniques to identify similarities and differences among them. The schema provided a visual representation of the table connections, while the data dictionary offered a detailed description of the values within each table. Additionally, the project encompassed the development of both simple and complex queries to facilitate diverse data analysis tasks.

A particular aspect of the project delved into an experimental topic that I personally found intriguing, providing in-depth insights. Furthermore, the concluding section of the project showcased the application of data visualization techniques to perform detailed analysis and gain valuable insights from the database. This demonstrated my ability to analyze databases and present information in a user-friendly manner.

In the context of making informed business decisions, it is imperative to present data in a manner that is easily comprehensible to stakeholders who may not possess an extensive understanding of the underlying data. Thus, the project emphasized the significance of creating clear and intelligible visualizations, ensuring that decision-makers can utilize the visualized data to make informed choices.

<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to my Tableau Project. </b> </center> </div>
<p>This project was completed in the Spring 2022 semester for the Data Visualization course. Multiple spotify datasets were analyzed based on different factors such as popularity,
danceability, beats per minute and loudness among others. The first visualization shows the top songs with danceability and energy in the dataset. The second visualization shows the loudness of music throughout the years
 and how it has increased throughout the years. The third visualization shows how energy and danceability have changed during the years and how they overlap. The other batch of visualizations are rankings and an analysis is
present at the end of the project. In business analyzing trends is important as you can examine and predict the movement of trends. Showing change in data over a period of time is useful as observing the popularity of a product or service 
can be helpful when implementing something new in the market. </p>

<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to the Project Management assignment. </b> </center> </div>
<p>This project was completed in the Spring 2022 semester for the Project Management course. This project provides an in-depth analysis on outsourcing in the information technology industry. This project shows a brief history on outsourcing,
the benefits, the negative aspects of it and why a company should use outsourcing or skip it entirely. This projects also uses information obtained from current and ex-employees from outsourcing companies and their positive and
negative experiences. This is relevant in the business environment in general as many of the tools and methods used in outsourcing are widely used now in the common business industry, especially the information technology field. </p>

      <h3>ZOOM: CULTIVATING HUMAN CONNECTION
IN A DIGITAL WORLD</h3>
<a href="file:///C:/Users/crmb1/Downloads/Article%202_%20Zoom%20Cultivating%20Human%20Connection%20in%20a%20Digital%20World.pdf">Link to the article</a>
     <p> The Zoom boom over the pandemic was a huge change for how we see technology as a tool. Covid 19 has totally changed how we operate on a day-to-day basis.  In the information technology system, there has been a major change as zoom and other video conference tools have allowed employees to work at home. Many employees who have transitioned to working from home have shown that they are more productive and happier. There are many benefits from this as there is no need for employers to rent office space or employees needing to be on-site to do their jobs. This can also affect careers as it is possible to recruit employees that live across the country or even the world without the need to move. The transformation of moving almost everything digitally was a worldwide change as many daily operations have been moved and have shown to be faster and easier to do. Documentation, interviews and even classes have proven to work in a digital only world. The tools that became available after covid are still widely used to this day and they continue to improve on them as they are now used more than ever in daily operations. </p>
