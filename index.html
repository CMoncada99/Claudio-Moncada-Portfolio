<p>The project above was completed in the Fall 2021 semester. The project analyzes multiple Spotify data sets and joins them to find similarities or differences with them. The schema shows the 
connections between tables. The data dictionary shows the values of each table. There are also a couple of simple and complex queries that show different data analysis.
A small part of the project goes further into detail in a experimental topic that I found interesting. The final part of the shows data visualization and analysis using the same data from the database.
Analyzing databases and displaying the information in a user-friendly way. When it comes to displaying data for important business decisions it is crucial that the visualizations
are clear and understandable for those who don't have full concept of the data so they can use that to come up with a decision.  </p>

<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to my Tableau Project. </b> </center> </div>
<p>This project was completed in the Spring 2022 semester for the Data Visualization course. Multiple spotify datasets were analyzed based on different factors such as popularity,
danceability, beats per minute and loudness among others. The first visualization shows the top songs with danceability and energy in the dataset. The second visualization shows the loudness of music throughout the years
 and how it has increased throughout the years. The third visualization shows how energy and danceability have changed during the years and how they overlap. The other batch of visualizations are rankings and an analysis is
present at the end of the project. In business analyzing trends is important as you can examine and predict the movement of trends. Showing change in data over a period of time is useful as observing the popularity of a product or service 
can be helpful when implementing something new in the market. </p>

      <h3>ZOOM: CULTIVATING HUMAN CONNECTION
IN A DIGITAL WORLD</h3>
<a href="file:///C:/Users/crmb1/Downloads/Article%202_%20Zoom%20Cultivating%20Human%20Connection%20in%20a%20Digital%20World.pdf">Link to the article</a>
     <p> The Zoom boom over the pandemic was a huge change for how we see technology as a tool. Covid 19 has totally changed how we operate on a day-to-day basis.  In the information technology system, there has been a major change as zoom and other video conference tools have allowed employees to work at home. Many employees who have transitioned to working from home have shown that they are more productive and happier. There are many benefits from this as there is no need for employers to rent office space or employees needing to be on-site to do their jobs. This can also affect careers as it is possible to recruit employees that live across the country or even the world without the need to move. The transformation of moving almost everything digitally was a worldwide change as many daily operations have been moved and have shown to be faster and easier to do. Documentation, interviews and even classes have proven to work in a digital only world. The tools that became available after covid are still widely used to this day and they continue to improve on them as they are now used more than ever in daily operations. </p>
